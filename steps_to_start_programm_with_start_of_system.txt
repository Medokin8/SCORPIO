1.  Move the script start_tracker.sh and file tracker.exe to the system's startup directory. 
    On Ubuntu it's /etc/init.d.

2.  Add the script to the system's startup sequence with the update-rc.d command.
    For Ubuntu, it's: sudo update-rc.d start_tracker.sh defaults

NOTE:
  !!!  Befor running the program you should chage the directory of saving file, because the one after download is /home/nikodem/   !!!

Info:
        start_tracker.sh just run prebuild tracker.exe in background (& option).
        make_tracker.sh rm old version of tracker.exe an compile tracker.cpp as tracker.exe
